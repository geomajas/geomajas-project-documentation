    <title>About this project</title>

    <para>Geomajas is a free and open source GIS application framework for
    building rich internet applications. It has sophisticated capabilities for
    displaying and managing geospatial information. The modular design makes
    it easily extendable. The stateless client-server architecture guarantees
    endless scalability. The focus of Geomajas is to provide a platform for
    server-side integration of geospatial data, allowing multiple users to
    control and manage the data from within their own browsers. In essence,
    Geomajas provides a set of powerful building blocks, from which the most
    complex GIS applications can easily be built. Key features include:</para>

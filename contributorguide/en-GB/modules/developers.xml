  <title>Developers information</title>

  <section>
    <title>maven compilation, targets, profiles, variables</title>

    <para>When doing an initial compilation of Geomajas, you may need to start
    compilation from the "backend" directory. Only when that is compiled,
    compilation from the project root will succeed.</para>

    <programlisting>cd backend
mvn install
cd ..
mvn install</programlisting>

    <para>The source contains one main pom which allows building of the
    Geomajas framework and each of the sample applications in one go.</para>

    <para>You can also choose to build them individually.</para>

    <para>There are a couple of profiles define should help during development:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><code>-Pnoshrink</code>: shrink profile (defined in the
        geomajas-dojo-client module) builds a shrinked version of the
        javascript files. The files are compressed and combined for faster
        loading and better caching.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><code>-Dbc</code>: when building everything (framework and
        examples), the "bc" enables the build-checkstyle profile which assures
        the project's checkstyle configuration is also built. This is normally
        not needed as the checkstyle dependencies are available from our maven
        repository.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><code>-Dhudson</code>: profile for running the selenium
        integration tests on the hudson continuous integration server. As long
        as running the tests on the ci server proves problematic, this will
        disable these tests.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>For development using the dojo face, apart from using the
    "-Pnoshrink" profile mentioned about, you may also want to configure the
    ResourceServlet to try to directly read the javascript files from disk
    before looking at the classpath (it also changes the cache headers). This
    allows a simple refresh in the browser to load the changed versions. The
    configuration in your web.xml needs an extra init-parameter like in this
    example..</para>

    <programlisting>&lt;servlet&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;ResourceServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;servlet-class&gt;org.geomajas.servlet.ResourceServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
    &lt;init-param&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;
            When this is specified, files are searched here first.
            Files which are found at this locations are not cached.
        &lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;param-name&gt;files-location&lt;/param-name&gt;
        &lt;param-value&gt;/home/me/apps/java/geomajas/geomajas/geomajas-dojo-client/src/main/resources&lt;/param-value&gt;
    &lt;/init-param&gt;
    &lt;load-on-startup&gt;3&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;
&lt;/servlet&gt;
</programlisting>

    <section>
      <title>Running the example applications</title>

      <para>Once you have done a "<code>mvn install</code>" on either the
      entire tree or the "Geomajas" directory, you can use maven to run the
      example applications.</para>

      <para>For the dojo face, you can run the examples using (when in the
      geomajas-dojo-example directory) <programlisting>mvn jetty:run</programlisting></para>

      <para>For the gwt face, you have two options. Once in the
      geomajas-gwt-simple directory, you can run the application in
      development mode using <programlisting>mvn gwt:run</programlisting></para>

      <note>
        <para>Due to classpath problems and the gwt-maven-plugin which does
        not properly handle excluded dependencies (the "provided" scope), this
        can fail on some systems.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Alternatively you can run the actual war using <programlisting>mvn jetty:run-war</programlisting><note>
          <para>It can be advisable to run "mvn clean" between "gwt:run" and
          "jetty:run-war" or the classpath problem from the previous footnote
          may appear again.</para>
        </note></para>
    </section>

  <section>
    <title>Documentation</title>

    <para>The documentation is split in three books.</para>

    <para><itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>developers guide: guide for developer who want to use
          Geomajas in their application.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>contributors guide: guide for people who want to contribute
          to the project or want to know more about the functioning of the
          project.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>end user guide: documentation for end users of applications
          built using Geomajas.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>

    <para>These documents are all written in docbook format to allow both PDF
    and HTML output formats. The sources can be found in the "documentation"
    directory of the project.</para>

    <!--
    <para>To generate the commands, from the Geomajas source tree, do the
    following to build the docbook output.</para>

    <programlisting>cd geomajas/src/docbook
mvn install</programlisting>

     To generate the project site, do (from the Geomajas source tree again) 

    <programlisting>cd geomajas
mvn site</programlisting>
-->

    <para>For editing the docbook files, we recommend using <ulink
    url="http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/">XMLMind</ulink>. The personal
    version is free and can (at the time of writing) be used for editing open
    source documentation.</para>

    <para>The docbook files are currently formatted using XMLMind. When using
    another tool for editing, please keep the current formatting to assure
    diffs remain usable.</para>

    <para>The devuserguide includes a lot of examples which are excerpts from
    the source of the example applications. This prevents copy-paste mistakes.
    The build process for the documentation automatically updates these
    excepts. It scans all files in the "application" directory. Excepts can be
    annotated using annotations like</para>

    <para><programlisting>&lt;!-- @extract-start AllowAllSecurity, Allow full access to everybody --&gt;
&lt;bean name="security.securityInfo" class="org.geomajas.security.SecurityInfo"&gt;
    &lt;property name="loopAllServices" value="false"/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
&lt;!-- @extract-end --&gt;</programlisting></para>

    <para>for XML or</para>

    <para><programlisting>// @extract-start filename, title
for (String line : lines) {
    // do something
}
// @extract-end</programlisting></para>

    <para>for java files. The start annotation includes the filename which
    should be used (all files are placed in the "listing" directory) and
    optionally a title for the example.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Versioning</title>

    <para>Version have a major.minor.patch structure.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
         major: indicates that this release has major advances over previous releases. New major versions do not need to be backwards compatible.
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
         minor: indicates that there are important new features that do not break compatibility with previous versions with the same major number. Even minor versions are used for "stable" versions which will be supported by Geosparc. Odd minor versions are used for work-in-progress and stabilisation efforts.
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
         patch: bugfixes and smaller improvements.
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>subversion, commits</title>

    <para>New committers need to sign an agreement which hands over copyright
    to Geosparc. Policies are needed for assigning commit rights (see
    below).</para>

    <para>All SVN commits should include the JIRA issue number at the start of
    the commit message, and a short description of the work done. The JIRA
    issue number allows linking the commits with the issues (as can be seen in
    JIRA), the short message allows persons to know what is happening without
    referring to JIRA. The only times JIRA issue number are not needed is for
    making "obvious" changes like fixing typos.</para>

    <para>Commits should be grouped by issue as much as possible/sensible
    (better two commits than one commit for fixing two issues, better one
    commit of five files than five commits of one file (for one
    issue)).</para>

    <para>Development of the "latest-and-greatest" version happens in
    "trunk".</para>

    <para>Continued development on earlier versions (when not
    "latest-and-greatest") occur in branches with the future version number as
    name.</para>

    <para>When a release is cut, a tag with the release version as name is
    created. The release should be built from the tagged files.</para>

    <para>After each commit, the system should still compile and all test
    cases should still succeed. There is a continuous integration engine
    (Hudson) which verifies this and send messages to the commit mailing list
    on failures.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Coding</title>

    <para>Note that details about coding style and naming are on the <ulink
    url="???">coding style</ulink> page.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Logging</title>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>When inserting debug statements, parameterized messages should
          be used to prevent the need/usefulness of
          <code>isDebugEnabled()</code>.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
           all logging is done through slf4f, logger is created using 

          <programlisting>private final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger( ContainingClassName.class );</programlisting>

            <listitem>If you are testing
            src/main/java/org/geomajas/ToBeTestedClass.java, create a class
            src/test/java/org/geomajas/ToBeTestedClassTest.java. Actual test
            methods have a name starting with "test". The class itself should
            extend jnit.framework.TestCase.</listitem>

    <section>
      <title>Exception handling</title>

      <para>*Never* throw away exception, either log them or throw them again
      (possibly wrapped). Do not log and throw, this only clutters log files
      with duplicate exceptions.</para>

      <para>Do not wrap exceptions unnecessarily (so no
      <code>GeomajasException</code> caused by a
      <code>GeomajasException</code>) unless you add additional information in
      the message.</para>

      <para>When wrapping an exception, always include the cause.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Refactoring</title>

      <para>Changes in the (public) API use a "deprecate, then remove" cycle.
      It should be marked "deprecated" in at least one minor version before it
      can be removed in the next major version.</para>

      <title>File encoding</title>

      <para>All source files, including .properties files should use UTF-8

    <title>Maven repository</title>

    <para>The Geomajas build has quite a few dependencies which are gathered
